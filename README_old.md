# blockchain-developer-bootcamp-final-project


As a part of the this the first exercise about the brain storming about our final project at BootCamp. 

I missed the initial office hours but i have a clear idea in my mind about my Final Project. Please find below :

1. An ERC 20 Token. I will create an ERC 20 Token NAMED "XYZ" with all ERC 20 funcationality. 
- ERC 20 Token
- The Test files to validate the ERC Token using Mocha and Chai.  
2. A Smart COntract with Exchange funcationility.(It  will be only Ether and XYZ for now)
-	 Deposit 
-	 WithDraw
-	 CheckBalance
-	 Order
-	 Fees
3. A Decentralised Application using React JS to present all the above funcationlity of an Exchange.


I am planning to do it on my local system and if possible and time permit i will deploy the smart contract in testnet and test it out.


NOTE: I am recently come across various centralised exchanges like binance, so come off with this idea how they work actually. Not sure if it is doable, but i will try it.


Please suggest i am going in wrong direction.
